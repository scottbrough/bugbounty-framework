# 🛠️ AI-Enhanced Bug Bounty Framework

This system is designed for elite bug bounty hunters who want to **scale output**, **maximize income**, and **eliminate low-ROI distractions**. Inspired by the top 1% of hackers, this framework uses GPT-4o and automation tools to supercharge the entire bug bounty lifecycle.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

- 🔍 **Filter signal from noise** using AI-powered target triage
- 🧠 **Accelerate learning** by automating recon + PoC + reporting loops
- 💰 **Track ROI** per bug, program, and hour of work
- ⚔️ **Build exploit chains** from multi-vuln paths
- 📈 **Systematize success** to grow faster than manual hunters

---

## 🔧 Modules Overview

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `discover.py` | Run passive + active recon (subfinder, amass, httpx, ffuf, etc.) |
| `ai_triage.py` | GPT-4o prioritizes high-potential targets |
| `attack_coordinator.py` | GPT builds attack chains and suggests payloads/tools |
| `verify.py` | GPT creates detailed PoCs in Markdown format |
| `report_engine.py` | GPT auto-writes HackerOne-style bounty reports |
| `roi_tracker.py` | Log time + payout per finding and compute $/hr |
| `chain_detector.py` | Link multiple bugs on a host into high-severity attack chains |
| `db_migrate_roi.py` | One-time schema migration for ROI tracking |

---

## 🧠 Workflow

```bash
# 1. Recon
python3 discover.py target.com

# 2. AI Triage
python3 ai_triage.py target.com

# 3. Attack Planning
python3 attack_coordinator.py target.com

# 4. Generate PoCs
python3 verify.py

# 5. Track Time + Payout
python3 roi_tracker.py target.com

# 6. Detect Chained Exploits
python3 chain_detector.py

# 7. Write Full Report
python3 report_engine.py

## 🧰 Requirements

Install core tools:

```bash
pip install openai
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
sudo apt install amass ffuf assetfinder dnsx -y
```

Make sure `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

---

## 🔐 API Setup

Set your OpenAI key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Add to `.zshrc` to persist it:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## 🐙 Upload to GitHub (on Kali)

```bash
git init
echo "workspace/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.db" >> .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - AI bounty framework"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-bugbounty-framework.git
git push -u origin main
```

Use a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) instead of password if 2FA is enabled.

## ✨ Features Coming Soon

* `fuzzer.py`: AI-powered payload injection and response validation
* `dashboard_api.py`: REST backend for ROI dashboard
* `program_selector.py`: AI recommendation engine for best bounty programs
* `learning_loop.py`: Train on past success/failure to improve triage

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “The top 1% of bug bounty hunters don’t just hack — they build systems.”

This framework isn’t just automation. It’s **strategic augmentation**:

* Smarter decisions
* Faster iteration
* Higher payout per hour

You don’t just find bugs — you run an AI-accelerated bounty lab.
